When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
To share our project with other people around the world so that they can see and share
their changes to it.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Manual pulling gives us the option to choose which commits I want to fetch. If I am 
working on something currently and in between some new commits are made and updated 
automatically on my local repo then it breaks the current line of commits I made
or about to make related to my current work.
