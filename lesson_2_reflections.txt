What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A .git directory is created which makes the directory a repository.
We must create a repo so that we can save different versions of files and access them whenever needed.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?
We can add files that we want to be included in the commit to the staging area.
Staging area acts as an intermediary between working directory and repository.
